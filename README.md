This project is for personally exploring and learning how to use Sqlite3 and Node.js.

This project is part of a project to create A.I. synthetic interview, biographical, conversation bots and to be a template for each of the 74 authors of "The Great Conversation" of the 443 written works in "The Great Books of the Western World" series. The idea is to create one template system and use it to automate creation of the 74+ author bots. Also included will be the authors of books composing the Christian Holy Bible although the author interviews might have to be uninformative or include comments by Biblical experts regarding the best scholarly ideas regarding authorship. Bots for Mortimer J. Adler and Robert Hutchins will also be created using the template system.

The completed Application will allow a user to choose a Great Idea topic and subtopic from 'The Great Conversation' of "The Great Books of The Western World" series and view The Great Conversation between the authors in both 2-d RPG and IRC chat modes. The user can also choose one of the 74+ authors to chat with about the author's life or written works. The template system initially reads the web about each author to populate the Great Conversation Bot personality knowledgebase. Eventually this could be extended to the creation of synthetic interviews for any author or famous person. E.g. Digital Aristotle, Digital Einstein, Darwin Synthetic Interview etc. 

The first minimum viable product will be a very simple beginner's CRUD HTML5 form interface that allows a user to choose a Great Idea and an author to be added to or verified to be in the Sqlite3 database of the 74 authors of written works in the "Great Books of the Western World" series.
The user is shown the Great Idea and author that they selected.

Sprint 2 will add canned biographical data and canned biographical questions to the database to be selected by the user. The template system will be generic to allow for automation of the database population. Google "Talk to Books" has similar answer retrieval functionality. 

Sprint 3 will put all authors in a simple Phaser 3, 2-d RPG with name labels for a sprite stickman or one human sprite for all authors. Authors will surround a large round table, being at the table when they speak or have something to say on the selected topic. It might be necessary to have concentric rings or zones for topics with 74+ author quotes. An author with nothing to say on a specific topic or subtopic can wander the tilemap or stay in one place to be visited by a player. Author contributions to the discussion will be shown in a name-plated text box at the bottom of the screen. Scripting the Great Conversation is going to be a MAJOR A.I. coding problem/challenge. 

Sprint 4 will add the canned Syntopicon list for the Great Idea of Love as a prototype. (maybe Education?)
The idea is to use the published Syntopicon as a test/verification and not to infringe on the IP rights of Brittanica or whoever currently holds the IP rights. If things progress far enough that there are any royalty/licensing problems, all work will be shifted to creating a Great Books of the Eastern World Syntopicon or Great Ideas of Spaceship Earth Syntopicon. Perhaps, this could be created in a globally co-operative Wiki manner.

Sprint ?? will add an IRC chat interface listing all of the authors with something to say on a Great Idea topic/subtopic on the right hand side and show author names and quotes on the left hand side as each author enters the conversation.  

Sprint ??  will add the ability to autonomously create a Syntopicon that duplicates that of the "Great Ideas" of the "Great Books of the western World".
This is a MAJOR design and coding problem.

Sprint ??   will create a list of authors and written works of Great Books of the Eastern World or Spaceship Earth.

Sprint ??   will populate the Great Books of the Eastern World biographical database using the author biography template

Sprint ?? will autonomously create a syntopicon for Great Books of the Eastern World (hopefully involving some type of internet collaboration with experts and interested developers in the Eastern World).  

Sprint ?? will create a syntopicon of Great Ideas of Spaceship Earth based on reading the web and ideas listed by Felipe Fernandez-Armesto, A.C.Grayling, Peter Watson and Robert Arp.

Sprint ??? Alexa Skill

Sprint ?? IBM Watson-powered version

Sprint ?? Add Cycorp Cyc commonsense knowledgebase 

Sprint ?? Global History of Science and Technologhy 2d/3d RPG

Sprint ?? Buckminster Fuller's World Peace Game A.I. moderator

Sprint ?? "The Work, Wealth and Happiness of Mankind" by H.G. Wells automated update

There is currently redundancy in the use of an HTML5 list to initially populate the sqlite database and decisions need to be taken regarding sealing off the database and pulling the form list from the database (while still allowing for admin creation of additional new records for each of the books of the Christian Holy Bible, Mortimer J. Adler and Robert M. Hutchins). For a while, the HTML5 list will be kept to keep things simple.
