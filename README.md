Experimentation with Sqlite as part of creating 76+ GREAT CONVERSATION chatbots (74 authors plus Hutchins and Adler + biblical authors. Each chatbot will have access to biographical material as well as their writings selected for inclusion in the first edition of 'Great Books of the Western World'.
(I currenty need to populate and seal off the database, the form just keeps adding to the database)

Next, one canned topic (LOVE) from the Syntopicon will be added while developing an A.I. system that can create its own syntopicon and direct all interested authors in a discussion on the chosen topic based on their written works.
Authors can also talk about their own lives. The discussion will be animated in a round table in RPG and IRC styles.

Then, the A.I. system will read the web autonomously and create or assist in the creation of a 'Great Ideas of the Eastern World Syntopicon' and chatbots
Also, the Western World chatbots will be updated to include all written works by each author as well as chatbots for additional readings as well as contemporary readings based on the web.
Eventually,I want to create A.I. systems that can read the web, reason and help create an updated version of 'The Work, Wealth and Happiness of Mankind' by H.G. Wells and be Bucky Fuller's World Peace Game assistants and moderators. Each chatbot will also have access to a Knowledge Web Brain (see James Burke and Connections for an historically accurate  World Game MMORPG.)
Search will be based on meaning rather than keywords. IBM WATSON DISCOVERY or a similar system might be helpful.


A starter that has a database

- This app uses sqlite but you can power your apps with [a number of other storage options](https://glitch.com/storage)
- `sqlite.db` is created and put into the `.data` folder, a hidden directory whose contents aren’t copied when a project is remixed. You can see the contents of `.data` in the console under "Logs"
- To save to the database, remix this app!

On the front-end,

- Edit `views/index.html`,  `public/style.css`, and `public/client.js`
- Drag in `assets`, like images or music, to add them to your project

On the back-end,

- Your app starts at `server.js`
- Add frameworks and packages in `package.json`
- Safely store app secrets in `.env` (nobody can see this but you and people you invite)

Click `Show` in the header to see your app live. Updates to your code will instantly deploy.
